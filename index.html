        <h1>AdvancedAI Conversational AI Terms</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 5 December 2024</p>

        <p>These Conversational AI Terms ("Service Terms") supplement your ("you", "your", or "Customer") existing agreement with AdvancedAI or, if no separate agreement exists, the AdvancedAI Terms of Service (either, the "Underlying AdvancedAI Agreement"). Your use of Conversational AI (defined below) is also subject to our <a href="#">Prohibited Use Policy</a> and <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a>. Defined terms used in these Service Terms have the meanings set forth in the Underlying AdvancedAI Agreement.</p>

        <p>By using Conversational AI, you agree to these Service Terms. If you do not agree or do not have the authority to agree, you are not permitted to use Conversational AI. These Service Terms constitute a legally binding contract between you and AdvancedAI. In case of any conflict between these Service Terms and other terms agreed upon between you and AdvancedAI, these Service Terms shall prevail with respect to your access or use of Conversational AI.</p>

        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> THESE SERVICE TERMS CONTAIN LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY IN SECTIONS 5 AND 7.</p>

        <h2>1. Conversational AI</h2>
        <p>"Conversational AI" is a solution offered by AdvancedAI that enables the deployment of interactive AI voice agents ("Customer AI Agent") as part of AdvancedAI's Services. Conversational AI is powered in part by one or more third-party LLM providers ("LLM Provider"). By using Conversational AI, you acknowledge and agree that you may interact with and direct information to these LLM Providers and that you must comply with applicable LLM Provider policies.</p>

        <h2>2. Restrictions</h2>
        <p>Customer shall not, and shall not permit its End Users (defined below) to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use Conversational AI or LLM Provider services in a manner that violates any applicable laws or infringes any party's intellectual property rights;</li>
            <li>Modify or create derivative works of Conversational AI or LLM Provider services;</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to discover the source code or underlying components of Conversational AI or LLM Provider systems;</li>
            <li>Use Conversational AI to develop competing large-scale models or services; or</li>
            <li>Submit sensitive data, such as financial account identifiers or health information, unless explicitly agreed upon by AdvancedAI in writing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Customer shall clearly inform its End Users that (a) they are interacting with AI rather than a human, and (b) conversations are being recorded and may be shared with AdvancedAI and LLM Providers. Customers must also update their privacy policies to reflect this use.</p>

        <h2>4. End Users</h2>
        <p>End Users must agree to an End User Agreement that includes restrictions, obligations, and prohibitions consistent with these Service Terms. Customers must not make representations about AdvancedAI's services beyond those in the Underlying AdvancedAI Agreement.</p>

        <h2>5. No Professional or Medical Advice</h2>
        <p>Output generated by Conversational AI is for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional advice in any field. Customers agree not to rely on such output as a substitute for professional advice.</p>

        <h2>6. Additional Disclaimers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>As-Is Basis:</strong> Conversational AI is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind.</li>
            <li><strong>No Warranty of Accuracy:</strong> AdvancedAI does not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of Conversational AI or any third-party services used.</li>
            <li><strong>No Warranty Against Harmful Components:</strong> AdvancedAI does not guarantee that Conversational AI or its services are free of harmful components.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, AdvancedAI shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, or any loss of profits, revenues, data, or goodwill resulting from your use of Conversational AI.</p>

        <h2>8. Overage Charges</h2>
        <p>If your usage exceeds the limits of your agreement, overage charges may apply. AdvancedAI will provide advance notice of potential charges, and upon request, detailed usage reports can be provided. These charges will be based on the applicable pricing terms.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about these terms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@advancedai.com">support@advancedai.com</a>.</p>
